# Managing Microsoft 365 with PowerShell

## Exercise 1: Managing users and groups in Microsoft Entra ID

### Task 1: Connect to Microsoft Entra ID

Microsoft Graph PowerShell works with PowerShell 7 and later. It's also compatible with Windows PowerShell 5.1.

The following prerequisites are required to use the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK with Windows PowerShell.

- Upgrade to PowerShell 5.1 or later

The PowerShell script execution policy must be set to remote signed or less restrictive. Use Get-ExecutionPolicy to determine the current execution policy. For more information, see **[Install the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation?view=graph-powershell-1.0)**.

1. On **LON-CL1**, select **Start**, and then enter **Windows PowerShell**.

1. In the results list, right-click **Windows PowerShell** or activate its context menu, and then select **Run as administrator**.

1. The PowerShell script execution policy must be set to remote signed or less restrictive, to set the execution policy, run the following command, and then type `A` and press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

1. To install the **Microsoft.Graph** module, in the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** console, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key (when prompted for confirmation, type `Y` and press the Enter key again twice in a row):
   
   ```powershell
   Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

1. After the installation is completed, you can verify the installed version with the following command:

    ```powershell
   Get-InstalledModule Microsoft.Graph
   ```

1. To connect to Microsoft.Graph, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   # Using interactive authentication for users, groups, teamsettings, RoleManagement.
   Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "User.ReadWrite.All", "Application.ReadWrite.All", "Sites.ReadWrite.All", "Directory.ReadWrite.All", "Group.ReadWrite.All", "RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory"
   ```

1. In the **Sign in to your account** window, enter the name of the user account with the Global Administrator role in the Microsoft Entra ID tenant you will be using in this lab, and then select **Next**.

1. At the **Enter password** prompt, enter your password, and then select **Sign in**.

1. To review a list of users in Microsoft Entra ID, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   Get-MgUser
   ```

### Task 2: Create a new administrative user

1. To retrieve your organization's verified domain, in the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** console, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```

1. To create a password profile for the new user, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   $PasswordProfile = @{  
    "Password"="<password>";  
    "ForceChangePasswordNextSignIn"=$true  
   }  
   ```

   >**Note:** Identify an arbitrary but complex password that you want to use for a new user and record it since you will need it later in this lab. Make sure that the password is at least 8 characters-long, including a combination of lower case letters, upper case letters, digits, and at least one special character.
   In the next step, replace `<password>` with the password you decided to use.

1. To create a new Microsoft Entra ID user, enter the following commands, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   New-MgUser -DisplayName "Noreen Riggs" -UserPrincipalName "Noreen@$verifiedDomain" -AccountEnabled -PasswordProfile $PasswordProfile -MailNickName "Noreen"
   ```

1. To store a reference to the new user in a variable, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   $user = Get-MgUser -UserId "Noreen@$verifiedDomain"
   ```

1. To store a reference to the Global Administrator role in a variable, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:
