      > **Note:** Notice that the **Type** data doesn't return what you might expect; for example, A and CNAME. Instead, it returns raw numerical data. Each number maps directly to a record type, and you can filter for those types when you know the map: 1= A, 5 = CNAME, and so on. Later in this module, you'll learn how to add more filters to determine the numbers and their corresponding record types. You'll notice a similar situation for other returned data, such as **Status** data.
