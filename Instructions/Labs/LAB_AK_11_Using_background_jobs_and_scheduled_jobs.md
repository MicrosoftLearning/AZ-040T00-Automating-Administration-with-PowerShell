# Jobs management with PowerShell

## Exercise 1: Starting and managing jobs

### Task 1: Start a Windows PowerShell remote job

1. Ensure that you're signed into **LON-CL1** as **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
1. Select **Start**, and then enter **powersh**.
1. In the results list, right-click **Windows PowerShell** or activate its context menu, and then select **Run as administrator**.
1. To start a Windows PowerShell remote job that retrieves a list of physical network adapters from **LON-DC1** and **LON-SVR1**, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   Invoke-Command –ScriptBlock { Get-NetAdapter –Physical } –ComputerName LON-DC1,LON-SVR1 –AsJob –JobName RemoteNetAdapt
   ```

1. To start a Windows PowerShell remote job that retrieves a list of Server Message Block (SMB) shares from **LON-DC1** and **LON-SVR1**, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   Invoke-Command –ScriptBlock { Get-SMBShare } –ComputerName LON-DC1,LON-SVR1 –AsJob –JobName RemoteShares
   ```

1. To start a Windows PowerShell remote job that retrieves all instances of the **Win32_Volume** class from every computer in Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), enter the following commands, and then press the Enter key after each:

   ```powershell
   Enable-PSRemoting –SkipNetworkProfileCheck –Force
   Invoke-Command –ScriptBlock { Get-CimInstance –ClassName Win32_Volume } –ComputerName (Get-ADComputer –Filter * | Select –Expand Name) –AsJob –JobName RemoteDisks
   ```

> **Note:** You need to enable PowerShell Remoting on LON-CL1 in order to connect to it by using PowerShell Remoting, which is, by default, disabled on Windows 10. The **RemoteDisk** targets all domain computers, including LON-CL1.

> **Note:** Because some of the computers in the domain might not be online, this job might not complete successfully. This is expected behavior.

### Task 2: Start a local job

1. To start a local job that retrieves all entries from the Security event log, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   Start-Job –ScriptBlock { Get-EventLog –LogName Security } –Name LocalSecurity
   ```

1. To start a local job that produces 100 directory listings, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   Start-Job –ScriptBlock { 1..100 | ForEach-Object { Dir C:\ -Recurse } } –Name LocalDir
   ```

> **Note:** This job will take a long time to complete. Don't wait for it to complete. Proceed to the next task.

### Task 3: Review and manage job status

1. Ensure that you're signed in to **LON-CL1** as **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
1. To display a list of running jobs, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   Get-Job
   ```

1. To display a list of running jobs whose names start with **remote**, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   Get-Job –Name Remote*
   ```

1. To stop the **LocalDir** job, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   Stop-Job –Name LocalDir
   ```

1. Run **Get-Job** until there are no jobs with the status of **Running**.
1. To receive the results of the **RemoteNetAdapt** job, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   Receive-Job –Name RemoteNetAdapt
   ```

1. To receive the results of the **RemoteDisks** job, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   Get-Job –Name RemoteDisks –IncludeChildJob | Receive-Job
   ```

## Exercise 2: Creating a scheduled job

### Task 1: Create job options and a job trigger

1. Ensure that you're signed in to **LON-CL1** as **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
1. To create a new job option, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   $option = New-ScheduledJobOption –WakeToRun -RunElevated
   ```

1. To create a new job trigger, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   $trigger1 = New-JobTrigger –Once –At (Get-Date).AddMinutes(5)
   ```

### Task 2: Create a scheduled job and retrieve results

1. To register the job, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   Register-ScheduledJob –ScheduledJobOption $option `
   –Trigger $trigger1 `
   –ScriptBlock { Get-EventLog –LogName Security } `
   –Name LocalSecurityLog
   ```

1. To display a list of job triggers, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   Get-ScheduledJob –Name LocalSecurityLog | 
   Select –Expand JobTriggers 
   ```

1. Note the time that displays, and then wait until the time returned in the output of step 2 has passed.
1. To display a list of jobs, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   Get-Job
   ```

1. To receive the job results, wait until 5 minutes passed from the time you registered the **LocalSecurityLog** job, then enter the following command, and press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   Receive-Job –Name LocalSecurityLog
   ```

> **Note:** Verify that the output consists of a list of log entries.

### Task 3: Use a Windows PowerShell script as a scheduled task

1. Switch to the console session to **LON-DC1** and, if needed, sign into **LON-DC1** as **Adatum\\Administrator** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
1. On **LON-DC1**, in **Server Manager**, select **Tools**, and then select **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
1. In the **Active Directory Users and Computers** console tree, select and expand **Adatum.com**, and then select **Managers**.

1. Select the **Member of** tab and verify that the user is a member of the Managers security group.
1. Select **OK** and then minimize **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
1. Select **Start**, enter **Task Scheduler**, and then select **Task Scheduler**.
1. In **Task Scheduler**, in the console tree, right-click **Task Scheduler (local)** or activate its context menu, and then select **Create Task**.
1. In the **Create Task** window, in the **General** tab, in the **Name** and **Description** boxes, enter **Remove Disabled User from Managers Security Group**. 
1. In the **Security options** section, select **Run whether user is logged on or not**, and then select the **Run with highest privileges** checkbox.
1. In the **Triggers** tab, select **New**.
1. In the **New Trigger** window, in **Settings**, select **Daily**, in the **Start time** box, change the time to 5 minutes from the current time, and then select **OK**.

   > **Note:** If you get a **Task Scheduler** pop-up window, select **OK**.

1. In the **New Action** window, in the **Program/script** box, enter **PowerShell.exe**.
1. In the **Add arguments (optional)** box, enter **-ExecutionPolicy Bypass E:\\Labfiles\\\Mod11\\DeleteDisabledUserManagersGroup.ps1**, select **OK** and then, in a pop-up window, select **Yes**.
