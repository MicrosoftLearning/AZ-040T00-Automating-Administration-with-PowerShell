# Using variables, arrays, and hash tables in PowerShell

## Exercise 1: Working with variable types

### Task 1: Use string variables

1. On **LON-CL1**, select **Start**, and then enter **powersh**.
1. In the results list, right-click **Windows PowerShell** or activate its context menu, and then select **Run as administrator**.
1. To set the `$logPath` variable, at the Windows PowerShell prompt, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   $logPath = "C:\Logs\"
   ```

1. To display the variable type for `$logPath`, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   $logPath.GetType()
   ```

1. To review the properties and methods for the `$logPath` variable, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

    ```powershell
    $logPath | Get-Member
    ```

1. To set the `$logFile` variable, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

    ```powershell
    $logFile = "log.txt"
    ```

1. To add the `$logFile` variable to the `$logPath` variable, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

    ```powershell
    $logPath += $logFile
    ```

1. To review the contents of the `$logPath` variable, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

    ```powershell
    $logPath
    ```

1. To replace **C:** with **D:** in the `$logPath` value, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

    ```powershell
    $logPath.Replace("C:","D:")
    ```

1. To replace **C:** with **D:** in `$logPath`, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

    ```powershell
    $logPath = $logPath.Replace("C:","D:")
    ```

1. To review the contents of the `$logPath` variable, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

     ```powershell
     $logPath
     ```

1. Leave the Windows PowerShell prompt open for the next task.

### Task 2: Use DateTime variables

1. To set the `$today` variable equal to today's date, at the Windows PowerShell prompt, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   $today = Get-Date
   ```

1. To review the variable type of the `$today` variable, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   $today.GetType()
   ```

1. To review the properties and methods for the `$today` variable, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   $today | Get-Member
   ```

1. To set a log file name based on the date, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   $logFile = [string]$today.Year + "-" + $today.Month + "-" + $today.Day + "-" + $today.Hour + "-" + $today.Minute + ".txt"
   ```

1. To calculate a date **30** days before today, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   $cutOffDate = $today.AddDays(-30)
   ```

1. To review users that have signed in for the last 30 days, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   Get-ADUser -Properties LastLogonDate -Filter {LastLogonDate -gt $cutOffDate}
   ```

1. Leave the Windows PowerShell prompt open for the next exercise.

## Exercise 2: Using arrays

### Task 1: Use an array to update the department for users

1. To query all users in the **Marketing** department, at the Windows PowerShell prompt, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   $mktgUsers = Get-ADUser -Filter {Department -eq "Marketing"} -Properties Department
   ```

1. To identify how many users are in the `$mktgUsers` variable, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   $mktgUsers.count
   ```

1. To review the first user in `$mktgUsers`, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   $mktgUsers[0]
   ```

1. To modify the department to **Business Development**, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   $mktgUsers | Set-ADUser -Department "Business Development"
   ```

1. To review the **Name** and **Department** of users in the `$mktgUsers` variable, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   $mktgUsers | Format-Table Name,Department
   ```

1. Review the output and verify that the Department values in the `$mktgUsers` variable haven't changed.

1. To query all users in the **Marketing** department, at the Windows PowerShell prompt, enter the following command, and then press the Enter key:

   ```powershell
   Get-ADUser -Filter {Department -eq "Marketing"}
